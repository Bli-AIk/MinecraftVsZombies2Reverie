## Features

### Energy

**Energy** is a resource used to place contraptions, corresponds to **sun** from Plants vs Zombies.

Without energy, it is impossible to place contraptions. Additional energy can be obtained by collecting Redstone or by using contraptions that produce energy.

You can only have up to 9,990 energy at a time.

### Contraptions

**Contraptions** are the weapons you use to attack enemies, corresponds to **plants** from Plants vs Zombies.

There are many different types of contraptions, such as: 

* **Dispenser** for attacking enemies.
* **Furnace** for producing redstone.
* **Obsidian** for blocking enemies.
* **Mine TNT** for blowing up enemies. 
* etc.

A specified amount of energy must be spent to place a contraption. After you place a contraption, you must wait a set amount of time for the contraption to recharge before placing it again. The time it takes for a contraption to recharge varies.

### Enemies

**Enemies** are what you need to defeat, corresponds to **zombies** from Plants vs. Zombies.

There are various kinds of enemies, such as:

* **Zombie** which is the most common.
* **Iron Helmet Zombie** which is tougher.
* **Skeleton** which shoots arrows to your contraptions.
* etc.

The core of the game is to judiciously use contraptions to defeat enemies.

### Gems

**Gems** are collectable objects, corresponds to **coins** from Plants vs Zombies.

There are three types of gems: 

* **Emeralds** which are worth 10.
* **Rubies** which are worth 50.
* **Diamonds** which are worth 1000.

After collecting enough gems, you can buy and unlock items from the store or from events to increase your power.

### Battlefields

**Battlefields** are where battles take place. Different battlefields have different effects.

For example: 
**Halloween** takes place at night, so you can’t get extra energy from the mine, and at every wave two Gargoyles are summoned to disrupt your formation.


### Starshards

**Starshards** are items capable of shifting the entire battlefield, corresponds to **plant food** from Plants vs Zombies.

When you defeat an enemy that is glowing green, it will drop a starshard. You can also get additional starshards from contraptions that produce them.

After using a starshard on a contraption, the contraption is **evoked**, erupting with enough power to shift the tide of battle.

Different contraptions have different **evocation abilities**. Using starshards wisely can reduce the game’s difficulty.

### Almanac

The **almanac** is an in-game item that contains additional information.

The almanac includes evocation abilities, as well as specific data on enemies and contraptions. You can also view characters from the story here, as well as some miscellaneous entries. 

### Bosses

**Bosses** are the goal of each chapter in Adventure Mode. You must defeat a chapter’s boss to unlock the next chapter.

Each boss has great power, which is a big challenge for players. However, they can easily be defeated once you figure out their weakness.
