    "talk.halloween_map.6.0.2": "Frankenstein? But that's just some fictional novel!",
    "talk.halloween_map.6.0.3": "I also thought that was the case... but it really does exist.",
    "talk.halloween_map.6.0.4": "Sorry for my negligence... the situation shouldn't have been like this.",
    "talk.halloween_map.6.0.5": "Don't worry, we just need to get the key back!",
